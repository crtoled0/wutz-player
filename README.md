# wutz-player
This is an electron project which together with wutz-app they work as an online Wurlitzer.

Basically the idea is that you have #wutz-player installed in any computer and load your music catalog as a regular mp3 player.
We are calling this desktop installed application host.
Then using wutzapp_pg application you can see the host local catalog, pick a song and added to a queue.
The song will be added to a queue on the host machine once the request arrived. Getting a Wurlitzer effect.
